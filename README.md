# C$50 Finance

This is a CS50 project, the description can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/9/finance/)

The poject could be amended in many ways, for example: the database management complies with the CS50 project`s requirements therefore it is really basic (no version controls, data type is not ideal for the purpose of handling transactions, db is included the the project etc) The URL-shortening project showcases better database handling.
